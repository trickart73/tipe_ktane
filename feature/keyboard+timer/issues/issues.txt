Differents issues encountered :

- l.37 (main)
"Morse morse;"

observation : when this line is no longer commented on, the program still compiles but no longer shows anything

idea: wrong syntax?


- State Timer Sound (timer.h)

observation : The module arrives in the state but once inside, the condition:
"if (current_time - last_time_note_playing_updated_> = delayValue)"
is never satisfied

Using the serial monitor, we see that delayValue = 1515 and currentTime >> delayValue (and last_time_note_playing_updated_ initialized to 0).

idea : ??
